<p>CA Maker allows you to build and simulate your own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton" target="_blank">elementary cellular automaton</a>. A cellular automaton (CA) is a group of cells in a particular state (in this case, black or white). Over time, the state of a cell may change, depending on the state of its neighbors, according to a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_90" target="_blank">rules</a>.</p>

<p>CA Maker uses the <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a> JavaScript library.</p>
